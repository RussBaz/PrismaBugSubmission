Run `npm run all` and check the result. The time between `now()` generated by Prisma and Postgres would be very different.

Mac Mini 2018 (Intel)
OS: MacOS 13.3.1 (a)
PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL 14.8 on aarch64-apple-darwin20.6.0, compiled by Apple clang version 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.9), 64-bit
Node: v20.1.0
NPM: 9.6.6

The result of `now()` inside the postgres is correct, however.
